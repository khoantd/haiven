    cursor: `# Haiven Rules for Cursor

This package contains AI coding rules optimized for Cursor IDE using the proper MDC format.

## Installation

1. Create a \`.cursor/rules\` directory in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Copy the \`.mdc\` files to the \`.cursor/rules\` directory
3. Restart Cursor IDE
4. The rules will be automatically applied to your AI coding sessions

## Usage

These rules provide system-level instructions to Cursor's Agent and Inline Edit features. They are written in MDC format with proper metadata for:
- **Always**: Rules that are always included in model context
- **Auto Attached**: Rules included when files matching glob patterns are referenced
- **Agent Requested**: Rules available to AI, which decides whether to include them
- **Manual**: Rules only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName

## Files

- Each \`.mdc\` file contains a specific rule in MDC format
- Rules include proper metadata (description, globs, alwaysApply)
- Rules are optimized for Cursor's AI features

## Rule Types

- **Always**: Always included in model context
- **Auto Attached**: Included when files matching glob patterns are referenced
- **Agent Requested**: Available to AI, which decides whether to include them
- **Manual**: Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName

## Support

For questions or issues, please refer to the Haiven documentation or Cursor's rules documentation: https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules
